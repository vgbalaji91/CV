                description: | During my time in pondicherry University I worked in the Synthetic polymers and mediciinal chemistry laboratory of <mark>Prof. K. Tharanikkarasu</mark>. Here I developed novel antimicrobial biopolymers. Specifically pendant group modificiation of chitosan via novel drug-design based molecules and tested them for antimicrobial activity.My work resulted in safe antimicrobial materials that were equal to or better than the commercially available antibiotics.

         Took the road less travelled:
|         I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Molecular docking</mark> and <mark>Protein-ligand docking</mark> during the pandemic lockdowns. It grew quickly into a fully fledged publication. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. This work has since been cited over a 100 times and is one of the most cited publications of the past 3 years in the Eur. J. Pharm.
