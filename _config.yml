         During my time in Pondicherry University I worked in the Synthetic polymers and mediciinal chemistry laboratory of <mark>Prof. K. Tharanikkarasu</mark>. Here I developed novel antimicrobial biopolymers. Specifically pendant group modificiation of <mark>chitosan</mark> via novel drug-design based molecules and tested them for antimicrobial activity. My work resulted in safe antimicrobial materials that were equal to or better than the commercially available antibiotics. Additional responsibilities included guidance of 7 Masters students, teaching <mark>organic chemistry</mark> <mark>wet-lab techniques</mark> and their capstone projects including disserations.

         During my time in Hyderbad I studied the courses covering both B.Sc. and M.Sc in chemistry. The first 3 years were covered all Physics, Biology and computer science as well. The final two years were focused singularly on all aspects of chemistry. THe last 6 months of the program included a capstone project at laboratory of <mark>Prof. Tushar Jana</mark>. Here I took part in the Synthesis and characterization of Organically-modified clay-composities of emulsion-cast polyurethanes</mark>.

          During my time here I studied both synthetic polymers as well as Biopolymers. But my primary focus was on the use small molecules to modify polysaccharides such as chitosan to enhance their antimicrobial activity. I also took part in collaborative research with medicinal chemists within my lab to explore anti-infectives via computational methods. add

         Took the road less travelled:|      I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Molecular docking</mark> and <mark>Protein-ligand docking</mark> during the pandemic lockdowns. It grew quickly into a fully fledged publication. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. This work has since been cited over a 100 times and is one of the most cited publications of the past 3 years in the Eur. J. Pharm.
